_last modified : 19-07-2019_

Here are listed all the datasets that can be used for object counting. Details are provided for each dataset to help find the correct one for a given task.

## Crowd Dataset (No Name)

The sequences in the dataset "have different field of views, resolutions, and exhibit a multitude of motion behaviors that cover both the obvious and subtle instabilities".

- Contains:
  - Pilgrimage
  - Station
  - Marathon
  - Rallies
  - Stadium

- Size:
  - Exact unspecified, 20 sequences of x (varying) images

- Article:
  - Title: Crowd Saliency Detection via Global Similarity Structure

## TRaffic ANd COngestionS (TRANCOS) dataset

This dataset regroups images containing extremely overlapping vehicles for counting in jammed traffic. The dataset was made using the publicly available video surveillance cameras of the "Dirección General de Tráfico of Spain".

- Contains:
  - Highway (maybe only)

- Size:
  - 1244 images
  - 46796 vehicles annotated

- Article:
  - Title: Extremely Overlapping Vehicle Counting
  - Authors: Ricardo Guerrero-Gómez-Olmedo, Beatriz Torre-Jiménez, Roberto López-Sastre, Saturnino Maldonado Bascón, and Daniel Oñoro-Rubio
