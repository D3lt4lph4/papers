# Deep Learning and stuff papers

This documentation aims to regroup and describe papers for various subjects in machine learning. There are other very good repositories on github with the same aom of regrouping and/or explaining, here is a list of the one I found so far:

- [Must Read](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers) This repository doesn't explain any of the paper, it makes a list of the must read articles in various subjects.

- [Frameworks](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning)

- [RoadMap](https://github.com/songrotek/Deep-Learning-Papers-Reading-Roadmap)

- [Awesome Recurrent Neural Networks](https://github.com/kjw0612/awesome-rnn)

- [Awesome Deep Vision](https://github.com/kjw0612/awesome-deep-vision)
