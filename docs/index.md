# Deep Learning and stuff papers

This documentation aims to regroup and describe papers for various subjects in machine learning. This repository/documentation is done as part of my PhD, if you were to find a mistake or inaccuracy please let me know so I can correct it.


There are other very good repositories on github with the same aim of regrouping and/or explaining machine learning stuff, here is a list of the ones I found so far:

- [Must Read](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers) This repository doesn't explain any of the paper, it makes a list of the must read articles in various subjects.

- [Frameworks](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning)

- [RoadMap](https://github.com/songrotek/Deep-Learning-Papers-Reading-Roadmap)

- [Awesome Recurrent Neural Networks](https://github.com/kjw0612/awesome-rnn)

- [Awesome Deep Vision](https://github.com/kjw0612/awesome-deep-vision)
