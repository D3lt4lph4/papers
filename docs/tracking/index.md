# Tracking

This section regroups all the papers about tracking stuff. If you are looking for a broad overview of how tracking is done you may want to look first at one of these surveys:

- [Deep Learning in Video Multi-Object Tracking: A Survey (19 Nov 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12740)

As always in deep learning, there is way too much published on the subject. I am not putting all the surveys and reviews here. You will find links to other surveys and reviews in the surveys and reviews above.
