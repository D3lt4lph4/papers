## Brief

**Problem:** Existing algorithms for speed estimation do not adapt well to variating position of the cameras. Espacially for estimating speed for each of the vehicles rather than the whole flux.

**Solution:** Combination of hand crafted detection, Kalman filter and Hungarian algorithm for tracking and calibration with four points on the road to transfer from pixel domain to road domain.

**Evaluated on:** Not specified, private.

**Results:**
