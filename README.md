# Papers

This repository aims to regroup summary of many deep learning papers and also provide some
kind of simple tool to search subjects related papers.

Anyone can contribute, just follow the skeleton for the description as much as possible, nothing too
strict, but having the same structure for all the summaries is much more simpler.

The doc is available [here](http://papers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), please read the Contributing section 
for more details.

I do not own any of the images in the "documentation", I try as much as possible to cite the authors, if no citation is on the image it means it comes from the paper being described. If you own any right to any image, feel free to contact me to have it removed.
